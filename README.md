## Dependencies
The package is built on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic Distribution. Make sure the ROS Noetic is installed before downloading the dependencies.
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt install curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Building

1. Create a catkin workspace.
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src && cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```

2. Download the package in src folder, make sure in main branch.
```
git clone https://github.com/anranli2003/KinfuROS
```
3. Build the package using either `catkin_make` or `catkin build` in catkin_ws folder.
```
catkin build
```

4. Source the workspace.
```
source devel/setup.bash
```
## Building the seg_preproc
1. Download the Depenedencies for k4a
   ```
   https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod/pool/main/libk/libk4a1.4/libk4a1.4_1.4.1_amd64.deb
   https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod/pool/main/libk/libk4a1.4-dev/libk4a1.4-dev_1.4.1_amd64.deb
   optionally: https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod/pool/main/k/k4a-tools/k4a-tools_1.4.1_amd64.deb
   ```
2. Download Tensor RT from Nvidia's website (Version 8.6.1 GA), assuming CUDA has already been installed
   ```
   https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-8x-download 
   ```
## Usage (for pre-recorded ROS bags)
Before running the package, make sure you build the package successfully and source the workspace.
1. Run the preproc package (
```
python3 ~/catkin_ws/src/seg_preproc/scripts/preproc.py
```
2 Launch the package using the following code.
```
roslaunch kinfu_semantic kinect_fusion_rviz.launch
```
3. Run the ROS bag containing pre-recorded
```
rosbag play {$bagname}.bag
```
## Useage (for real-time camera capture)
Before running the package, make sure you build the package successfully and source the workspace. Make sure to also install the Microsoft Azure Camera driver on your computer and is able to connect.
1. Run the preproc package (
```
python3 ~/catkin_ws/src/seg_preproc/scripts/preproc.py
```
2. Run the Azure Kinect driver to connect camera
```
roslaunch azure_kinect_ros_driver slam_rtabmap.launch
```
3. Launch the package using the following code.
```
roslaunch kinfu_semantic kinect_fusion_rviz.launch
```
